# -CodeAlpha-Stock-Portfolio-Tracker-using-Python.
A Stock Portfolio Tracker using Python is a program that helps users monitor their investments by tracking stock prices, quantities owned, and overall portfolio value. It can fetch real-time market data using APIs, calculate gains or losses, and display performance summaries.
